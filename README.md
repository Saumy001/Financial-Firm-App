## 🚀 How This Project Was Built

- The initial code was generated using **Vercel v0** — an AI tool that converts UI screenshots into functional React/Next.js code.
- I provided screenshots of a similar finance dashboard application to Vercel v0.
- It generated starter UI code, which I then customized extensively:
  - Defined **custom routing** using `router.push()` for navigation.
  - Created reusable components for common UI elements.
  - Designed layouts for dashboards, reports, and user profiles from scratch.

##  Features

- 📊 Modular dashboards with real-time financial report structure
- 🔁 Reusable UI components (e.g., Header, Profile Card, Reporting Layout)
- 🔍 Organized folder structure using Next.js App Router
- ✨ Vercel v0 starter with custom tweaks to UI and routing
- 📈 Reports: balance sheets, hedge funds, income statements
- 🔐 Profile and report sections tailored for financial use cases
